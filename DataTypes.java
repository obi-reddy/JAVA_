# Data Types and Uses

Java supports a wide range of data types, which can be used to store and manipulate different kinds of data.
  Some of the most common data types in Java include:

1. Primitive Data Types: These are the basic data types in Java, and they include
boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, and double. These data types are used to store simple values like numbers and boolean values.

2. Object Data Types: Java also supports object data types, which include String, Arrays, and 
other user-defined classes. These data types are used to store more complex data, such as text strings, collections of data, and custom data structures.

Data types are useful in Java because they provide a way to represent and manipulate data in a consistent and structured way.
  This makes it easier to write, read, and maintain Java programs, especially when working with large and complex data sets.
  Additionally, the use of data types can help improve the performance of Java programs, by allowing the JVM to allocate memory more efficiently and by 
  reducing the overhead of type conversion during runtime. Overall, understanding the different data types in Java is an important part of becoming 
  proficient in the language, and can help you write more effective and efficient code.
