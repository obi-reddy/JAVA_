#comments 

There are two types of comments in Java:

1. Single-line comments: These comments start with two forward slashes (//) and continue until the end of the line. For example:

```
// This is a single-line comment
int x = 10; // This is also a single-line comment
```

2. Multi-line comments: These comments start with /* and end with */. They can span multiple lines. For example:

```
/*
This is a multi-line comment
It can span multiple lines
*/
int y = 20; /* This is also a multi-line comment */
```

Comments can be useful in many ways:

1. Documentation: Comments can be used to document the purpose, behavior, and limitations of your code. This makes it easier for other developers to understand and use your code.

2. Debugging: Comments can help you debug your code by providing additional information about specific sections of your code.

3. Code organization: Comments can help you organize your code by dividing it into sections or by grouping related statements together.

4. Reminders: Comments can also be used as reminders to yourself or to other developers about future improvements, TODOs, or bug fixes.

In general, writing clear and concise comments is an important skill for developers, as it can make your code more readable, maintainable, and accessible to others.
