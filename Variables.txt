In Java, a variable is a container that stores a value of a specific data type. Variables can be used to store and manipulate data in a program. Java variables can be of various types, including primitive types (integers, booleans, floats, doubles, chars) and reference types (objects, arrays).

Declaring variables in Java involves specifying the data type of the variable and giving it a name. For example, to declare an integer variable named "age", you would write:

```
int age;
```

This creates a variable of type int named "age", but it does not assign a value to it. To assign a value to the variable, you would write:

```
age = 62;
```

Alternatively, you can declare and assign a value to a variable in a single statement:

```
int age = 62;
```

Java also allows you to declare and initialize multiple variables of the same type in a single line, like this:

```
int x = 10, y = 20, z = 30;
```

Variable names in Java must follow certain rules. They must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign, and can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. Java is case-sensitive, so "age" and "Age" are two different variable names.

Variables can be used in Java expressions to perform operations and manipulate data. For example:

```
int sum = x + y;
int product = x * y;
boolean isEven = x % 2 == 0;
```

Variables can also be passed as arguments to methods and returned as values from methods.

Java has several variable scopes, including local, instance, and class scopes. Local variables are declared within a method or block and are accessible only within that method or block. Instance variables are declared within a class but outside any method or block and are accessible to all methods of the class. Class variables, also called static variables, are declared with the static keyword and are shared by all instances of the class.
